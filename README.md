Si5351 Library for avr-gcc on ATtiny Microcontrollers
=====================================================
This is a basic library for the Si5351 series of clock generator ICs from [Silicon Labs](http://www.silabs.com) for the avr-gcc development environment. It will allow you to control the Si5351 with an AVR ATtiny microcontroller with a USI peripheral module and preferably at least 8 kB of flash memory, without depending on the proprietary ClockBuilder software from Silicon Labs.

This library is focused towards usage in RF/amateur radio applications, but it may be useful in other cases. However, keep in mind that coding decisions are and will be made with those applications in mind first, so if you need something a bit different, please do fork this repository. Also, since the Si5351A3 version is the one which seems most useful in amateur radio applications, this is where the current development will be focused. Once the Si5351A3 has a decent and mature feature set, hopefully we will be able to turn to the 8-output version, and perhaps even the B and C variants.

Hardware Requirements and Setup
-------------------------------
An 8-bit AVR ATtiny microcontroller with the USI peripheral is required for this library. The code size of the library, compiled with a simple program to set the output frequency on all three clock outputs of a Si5351A3 is 3826 bytes (using avr-gcc version 4.8.2), therefore it is best used with a microcontroller with at least 8 kB of flash memory.

The Si5351 is a +3.3 V only part, so if you are not using a +3.3 V microcontroller, be sure you have some kind of level conversion strategy.

Wire the SDA and SCL pins of the Si5351 to the corresponding pins on the AVR. Since the I2C interface is set to 400 kHz, use 4.7 k&Omega; pullup resistors from +3.3 V to the SDA and SCL lines.

Connect a 25 MHz or 27 MHz crystal with a load capacitance of 6, 8, or 10 pF to the Si5351 XA and XB pins. Locate the crystal as close to the Si5351 as possible and keep the traces as short as possible. Please use a SMT crystal. A crystal with leads will have too much stray capacitance.

Usage
-----
Include the si5351-avr-tiny-minimal.c, si5351-avr-tiny-minimal.h, USI_TWI_Master.c, and USI_TWI_Master.h files into your avr-gcc project as you would with any other standard project.

The functions of the library are documented in the code. It should be fairly self-explanatory, but here's a very short introduction.

Before you do anything with the Si5351, you will need to initialize the communications and the IC. Let's initialize communications with the Si5351, specify the load capacitance of the reference crystal, and to use the default reference oscillator frequency of 25 MHz:

    si5351_init(SI5351_CRYSTAL_LOAD_8PF, 0)

Next, let's set the CLK0 output to 14 MHz):

    si5351_set_freq(14000000UL, SI5351_CLK0);

If we like we can adjust the output drive power:

    si5351_drive_strength(SI5351_CLK0, SI5351_DRIVE_4MA);

Also, there will be some inherent error in the reference crystal's actual frequency, so we can measure the difference between the actual and nominal output frequency in Hz, multiply by 10, make it an integer, and enter this correction factor into the library. With an accurate measurement at one frequency, this calibration should be good across the entire tuning range:

    si5351_set_correction(-900);

One thing to note: the library is set for a 25 MHz reference crystal. If you are using a 27 MHz crystal, please enter the reference oscillator frequency as the 2nd parameter in the si5351_init() function.

Also, the si5351_init() function sets the crystal load capacitance for 8 pF. Change this value if you are using a crystal with a different load capacitance.

Setting the Output Frequency
----------------------------
As indicated above, the library accepts and indicates clock frequencies in units of 1 Hz, as an _unsigned long_ variable type (or _uint32_t_). When entering literal values, append "UL" to make an explicit _unsigned long_ number to ensure proper tuning.

The most simple way to set the output frequency is to let the library pick a PLL assignment for you. You do this by using the si5351_set_freq() function, which will use a PLL frequency of 900 MHz and assign all multisynths (clock outputs) to PLLA. This function will also calculate the PLL parameters based on the correction factor set with the si5351_set_correction() function:

    si5351_set_freq(10140000UL, SI5351_CLK0);

You may also manually set the output frequency by specifiying the A, B, and C divider values for both the PLLs and multisynths (each fractional synth divides by `a * b/c`):

    struct Si5351Frac pll_frac, ms_frac;

    // Set PLLA to 600 MHz (600 MHz / 25 MHz = 24)
    pll_frac.a = 24;
    pll_frac.b = 0;
    pll_frac.c = 1;
    si5351_set_pll(pll_frac, SI5351_PLLA);

    // Set MS0 (CLK0) to 10 MHz (600 MHz / 10 MHz = 60)
    ms_frac.a = 60;
    ms_frac.b = 0;
    ms_frac.c = 1;
    si5351_set_ms(SI5351_CLK0, ms_frac, 0, SI5351_OUTPUT_CLK_DIV_1, 0);

Note that this does not use si5351_set_correction() to integrate the correction factor into the PLL tuning. Consult the si5351_set_freq() code to see how that is accomplished.

Further Details
---------------
If we like we can adjust the output drive power:

    si5351_drive_strength(SI5351_CLK0, SI5351_DRIVE_4MA);

The drive strength is the amount of current into a 50&Omega; load. 2 mA roughly corresponds to 7 dBm output and 8 mA is approximately 14 dBm output.

Individual outputs can be turned on and off. In the second argument, use a 0 to disable and 1 to enable:

    si5351_output_enable(SI5351_CLK0, 0);

You may invert a clock output signal by using this command:

    si5351_set_clock_invert(SI5351_CLK0, 1);

Calibration
-----------
There will be some inherent error in the reference oscillator's actual frequency, so we can account for this by measuring the difference between the uncalibrated actual and nominal output frequencies, then using that difference as a correction factor in the library. The set_correction() method uses a signed integer calibration constant measured in parts-per-ten million. The easist way to determine this correction factor is to measure the actual frequency of a 10 MHz signal from one of the clock outputs, calculate how many Hz it differs from the nominal frequency of 10000000 Hz, then use that number in the set_correction() method in future use of this particular reference oscillator. Once this correction factor is determined, it should not need to be measured again for the same reference oscillator/Si5351 pair unless you want to redo the calibration. With an accurate measurement at one frequency, this calibration should be good across the entire tuning range.

The calibration method is called like this:

    si5351_set_correction(-61);

One thing to note: the library is set for a 25 MHz reference crystal. If you are using a 27 MHz crystal, use the second parameter in the si5351_init() function to specify that as the reference oscillator frequency.

Phase
------
The phase of the output clock signal can be changed by using the set_phase() method. Phase is in relation to (and measured against the period of) the PLL that the output multisynth is referencing. When you change the phase register from its default of 0, you will need to keep a few considerations in mind.

Setting the phase of a clock requires that you manually set the PLL and take the PLL frequency into account when calculation the value to place in the phase register. As shown on page 10 of Silicon Labs Application Note 619 (AN619), the phase register is a 7-bit register, where a bit represents a phase difference of 1/4 the PLL period. Therefore, the best way to get an accurate phase setting is to make the PLL an even multiple of the clock frequency, depending on what phase you need.

If you need a 90 degree phase shift (as in many RF applications), then it is quite easy to determine your parameters. Pick a PLL frequency that is an even multiple of your clock frequency (remember that the PLL needs to be in the range of 600 to 900 MHz). Then to set a 90 degree phase shift, you simply enter that multiple into the phase register. Remember when setting multiple outputs to be phase-related to each other, they each need to be referenced to the same PLL.

    // We will output 14.1 MHz on CLK0 and CLK1.
    // A PLLA frequency of 705 MHz was chosen to give an even
    // divisor by 14.1 MHz.
    struct Si5351Frac pll_frac, ms_frac;

    // Set PLLA to 705 MHz (600 MHz / 25 MHz = 28.2)
    pll_frac.a = 28;
    pll_frac.b = 2;
    pll_frac.c = 10;
    si5351_set_pll(pll_frac, SI5351_PLLA);

    // Set CLK0 and CLK1 to use PLLA as the MS source
    si5351.set_ms_source(SI5351_CLK0, SI5351_PLLA);
    si5351.set_ms_source(SI5351_CLK1, SI5351_PLLA);

    // Set CLK0 and CLK1 to output 14.1 MHz (705 MHz / 14.1 MHz = 50)
    ms_frac.a = 50;
    ms_frac.b = 0;
    ms_frac.c = 1;
    si5351_set_ms(SI5351_CLK0, ms_frac, 0, SI5351_OUTPUT_CLK_DIV_1, 0);
    si5351_set_ms(SI5351_CLK1, ms_frac, 0, SI5351_OUTPUT_CLK_DIV_1, 0);

    // Now we can set CLK1 to have a 90 deg phase shift by entering
    // 50 in the CLK1 phase register, since the ratio of the PLL to
    // the clock frequency is 50.
    si5351_set_phase(SI5351_CLK0, 0);
    si5351_set_phase(SI5351_CLK1, 50);

    // We need to reset the PLL before they will be in phase alignment
    si5351_pll_reset(SI5351_PLLA);


Constraints
-----------
* Two multisynths cannot share a PLL with when both outputs are < 1.024 MHz or >= 112.5 MHz.

* Setting phase will be limited in the extreme edges of the output tuning ranges. Because the phase register is 7-bits in size and is denominated in units representing 1/4 the PLL period, not all phases can be set for all output frequencies. For example, if you need a 90&deg; phase shift, the lowest frequency you can set it at is 4.6875 MHz (600 MHz PLL/128).
